                <p>We update our policies from time to time, so we may need to change the Privacy Policy as well. But we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on our website or via other services such as sending you an email and/or by other means. Please note that if you’ve opted out from receiving legal mails from us (or you haven’t shared your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.
